1.  Creating empty array.
2.  Adding to array objects lambda.
    They are putting out information about smth(I don`t understand this moment a while)(Maybe some action).
3.  In Playground class initializing getters & setters for specific fields.
4.  Initializing arena_name & players(empty array).
5.  For each element of the array of hash-objects player_involved calling method create_player in 
    class PlayersFactory where we have some attributes.
6.  Adding lambdas to players array.
7.  Calling PlayersFactory.create_player, 
    then each player creates a lambda, 
    which expects the input parameters own_block, 
    more is obtained by inserting the block ({p "I`m glad to play on # {self.arena_name}"}), 
    then call own_block. call (this assumes that parameter own_block got to lambda-object)
8.  Calling each lambda-object from array players to transfer it as parameter 
    lambda-element array of objects according to their actions ordinal index. 

That`s all what I`ve undestood. =^_^=
